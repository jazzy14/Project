### <p align = "center"> GuruCool is a one-in-all progressive classroom management solution to online education with Gamified approach to learning and enhanced Moderation functions for educators </p>

## INSPIRATION ‚≠ê
As the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic encapsulated millions of students worldwide inside their homes, the Education industry underwent a multitude of changes to adapt to the scenario, while everyone gradually accustomed themselves to the online classroom environment. Even though it is technically not possible to emulate a physical classroom experience, there has been unanimous efforts at making the online teaching-learning process more streamlined to suit both the educators as well as the students. Despite the introduction of various utilities, a major disadvantage loomed - the inability of students to focus on the lectures, in addition to the teachers and professors not being in control of what the students are doing in the midst of classes. Noticeably, students tend to browse other websites or get hooked onto their phones during the class. Teachers, not necessarily being aware of this, are unable to take any action to ensure proper attention of the learners. Furthermore, the educators always look for a method to make their monotonically tedious tasks like taking attendance much easier whilst also keeping a check on the student activity. 

## OUR SOLUTION üìå
Getting inspired after investigating the problems faced by our own professors, we decided to build a platform that becomes the mediating utility tool for all educators, allowing them to effectively moderate the students and ensuring the engagement of the learners by making the classes more attractive and fun by the use of gamification and reward theory. GuruCool is a multifunctional all-in-one web application and classroom management tool that teachers can utilize in order to keep a check and increase student attention during an ongoing lecture with the help of Gamification (using a Quiz event trigger), where the learners need to answer the question within a stipulated time set by the teacher on the class topic. The Attention Index of a student is determined by how many questions they have answered correctly, which is reflected in the quiz leaderboard. Additionally, the application provides teachers with multiple moderation tools for perusal.

## THE NEED AND NOVELTY ‚úí

* Gamification of education is a strategy for increasing engagement by incorporating game elements into an educational environment. The goal is to generate levels of involvement equal to what games can usually produce. The main goals of gamification are to enhance certain abilities, introduce objectives that give learning a purpose, engage students, optimize learning, support behavior change, and socialize. Stimulated by the effects that game elements can produce, many researchers have looked into the influence of gamification in an educational context, getting favorable results, such as the increase of engagement, user retention, knowledge, and cooperation.

* Gamification is a PROVEN EFFECTIVE strategy in business development and skill assessments. Keeping this in mind, our motive is to introduce the concept gamification in everyday education with the help of our platform.This will not only add a fun factor to boring lectures, but will also increase overall attention and engagement by fuelling competitiveness among everyone. This will be the maiden classroom management tool with features of moderation and Gamification, thus benefiting both educators and students.
* The conceptual idea of Gamification, especially the need of a point-based engagement system was well-received by students and professionals worldwide. It is thought as a gateway to increase overall productivity with the introduction of a single gamified application, thereby improving user engagement manifolds. The education industry will reach new standards with a Gamified approach to e-learning. Our idea is not only technically feasible, but also cost-effective, with ease of addition of new functionalities for proper streamlined experience.
